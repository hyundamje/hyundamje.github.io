### Tekken
<ul style="margin-top:0.25rem">
<li> I started playing Tekken 3 on the PlayStation 1 as a child. In 2009, I joined Tekken Team “Axis of Evil,” based in Pyeongchon and Seoul. I spent much of my early time at Green Arcade, a central hub of the Korean Tekken scene. Our team appeared on Tekken Crash, a nationally broadcast competition.
This video shows one of our matches against Resurrection, including Knee,
widely regarded as the greatest player in Tekken history
(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yewekjGoKFc" target="_blank">video</a>). </li>
