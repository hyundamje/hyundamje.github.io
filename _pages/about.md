<p>Welcome! My name is Hyundam Je (<span style="font-size:85%">제현담/諸炫潭</span>), where Hyun (<span style="font-size:85%">현/炫</span>) means "shimmering" and Dam (<span style="font-size:85%">담/潭</span>) means "lake."</p>

  <p>I am a Research Fellow at the School of Economics at the University of Sydney working with <a href="https://www.tymula.com/agnieszka/" target="_blank">Agnieszka Tymula</a>. I'm a behavioral economist studying how people make decisions under uncertainty, limited information, and cognitive constraints, mostly using experimental methods. I received my PhD in Economics from Texas A&M University in 2023, under the supervision of <a href="http://people.tamu.edu/~alexbrown/" target="_blank">Alex Brown</a>.</p>

  <p>As a guitar player, I’ve been deeply influenced by John Mayer, John Frusciante, and Jimi Hendrix.</p>

  <p> I’m always happy to chat about research, ideas, or anything else. Who knows? We might end up as coauthors: <a href="mailto:hyundamje@gmail.com">hyundamje@gmail.com</a></p>
