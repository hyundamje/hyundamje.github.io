Welcome! My name is Hyundam Je (제현담 諸炫潭), where *Hyun* (현炫) means “blue” and *Dam* (담潭) means “lake.”

I’m a Research Fellow in the School of Economics at the University of Sydney, working with Agnieszka Tymula. My research focuses on behavioral and experimental economics, as well as decision theory. I study how people make decisions—particularly in contexts involving uncertainty, information acquisition, motivated reasoning, and gambling—using experimental methods.

As a guitar player, I’ve been deeply influenced by John Mayer, John Frusciante, and Jimi Hendrix.
